# Web-scraping-challenge

Project Overview:

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ This project has two parts: scraping Mars news and analyzing Mars weather data. Let me break it down for you:

Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

We'll browse the Mars news site and grab the titles and preview text of articles.
After that, we'll organize this info into neat dictionaries and lists.
If you want, we can even save this data in a handy JSON file!
Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

Here, we're diving into Mars' temperature data. We'll use Beautiful Soup to scrape it.
Then, we'll sort this data into a Pandas DataFrame.
Get ready for some cool analysis! We'll answer questions about Martian months, days, temperatures, and atmospheric pressure.
Plus, we'll visualize how long a Martian year is based on daily minimum temperature.
For detailed steps, just dive into the Jupyter Notebooks provided.
